# CellsCounter
The code calculates the required dilution factor for a given cell
density, based on parameters such as the average number of cells per
droplet and the measured optical density. It also calculates the
probability of having a certain number of cells in a droplet using a
Poisson distribution. The code, is based on the assumption of a typical
OD of E.coli. This can be changed using FACS
