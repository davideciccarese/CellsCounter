# CellsCounter for microfluidic droplet preparation

'CellsCalculator' The code estimate the Poisson distribution of cell numbers in droplets, based on the initial optical density. This estimation assumes a typical optical density at 600 nm corresponding to a specific number of E. coli cells per ml.

'CellsCalculator_2Species_FACS' The code estimates the Poisson distribution of cell numbers in droplets, consisting of a mixture of two species, using FACS quantification.

'CellsCalculator_2Species' The code estimates the Poisson distribution of cell numbers in droplets, consisting of a mixture of two species, using the optical density (OD 600).
